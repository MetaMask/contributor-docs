# Mocking APIs in MetaMask Mobile for Enhanced E2E Testing

## Introduction

This document outlines how MetaMask Mobile uses API mocking to boost End-to-End (E2E) testing. Mocking lets us simulate different conditions that the app might face, ensuring it functions reliably across various scenarios.

## Mocking vs. E2E Testing

While E2E tests verify the overall user experience, mocking focuses on testing individual components. Here’s how they differ:

- **E2E Tests**: These validate the app's functionality as a whole, interacting with real APIs and backend services.
- **Mocking**: Simulates responses from APIs, allowing us to test components in specific network conditions or edge cases.

We use mocking to enhance our E2E testing, especially for scenarios where E2E alone might be unreliable or tricky to set up.

## File Structure

We keep E2E and mock tests separate with file naming conventions:

```
root/
├── e2e/
│   ├── spec/
│   │   ├── Accounts/
│   │   │   └── spec.js
                mock.spec.js# Mock test for Accounts
│   │   ├── Transactions/
│   │   │   └── spec.js
                mock.spec.js # Mock test for Transactions
│   ├── api-mocking/
│       ├── api-mocking/
│       │   ├── mock-responses/
│       │   │   ├── gas-api-responses.json
```

This structure promotes clear organisation and makes managing tests simpler.

## Mock Server Implementation

### Overview

We use Mockttp to simulate API responses, providing flexible testing across different HTTP methods. This allows us to test app behaviour even when external dependencies are unavailable or unreliable.

### Key Features

- Supports multiple HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.)
- Configurable requests and responses
- Logs responses to simplify debugging

### Naming Mock Test Files

Mock test files are named with `.mock.spec.js` to keep things organised. For example, a test for the suggested gas API would be named: `suggestedGasApi.mock.spec.js`.

### Setting Up the Mock Server

The `startMockServer` function in `e2e/api-mocking/mock-server.js` starts the mock server. It takes events organised by HTTP methods, specifying the endpoint, response data, and request body (for POST requests).

```javascript
import { mockEvents } from '../api-mocking/mock-config/mock-events';

mockServer = await startMockServer({
  GET: [mockEvents.GET.suggestedGasApiErrorResponse],
  POST: [mockEvents.POST.suggestedGasApiPostResponse],
});
```

### Defining Mock Events

`mockEvents.js` defines mock events, including:

- `urlEndpoint`: The API endpoint being mocked
- `response`: The mock response the server will return
- `requestBody`: Expected request body (for POST requests)

```javascript
export const mockEvents = {
  GET: {
    suggestedGasApiErrorResponse: {
      urlEndpoint: 'https://gas.api.cx.metamask.io/networks/1/suggestedGasFees',
      response: { status: 500, message: 'Internal Server Error' },
    },
  },
  POST: {
    suggestedGasApiPostResponse: {
      urlEndpoint: 'https://gas.api.cx.metamask.io/networks/1/suggestedGasFees',
      response: { status: 200, message: 'Success' },
      requestBody: { priorityFee: '2', maxFee: '2.000855333' },
    },
  },
};
```

### Response Structure

Mock responses are stored in individual JSON files for each API or service within the `mock-responses` folder, making them easier to maintain and manage. Each API service has its own JSON response file, such as `gasApiResponse.json` for gas-related responses and `ethpriceResponse.json` for Ethereum price responses. This organisation enables clear separation of mock data and simplifies updates or additions.

**Example:** `gasApiResponse.json`

```json
{
  "suggestedGasApiResponses": {
    "error": {
      "message": "Internal Server Error"
    }
  },
  "suggestedGasFeesApiGanache": {
    // ... detailed gas fee data ...
  }
}
```

## Logging

The mock server logs response statuses and bodies to help track mocked requests, making debugging more straightforward.

## Using Mock Testing Effectively

### When to Use Mocks:

- For testing isolated features without relying on live data
- For testing edge cases that are tricky to reproduce with real data
- For deterministic test results by controlling inputs and outputs

### When Not to Use Mocks:

- Stable Live Environments: When APIs and services are reliable, testing live ensures production-like accuracy.
- Integration Testing: Live tests validate interactions with third-party services, capturing real-world behaviour.
- Performance Testing: Only live environments provide accurate latency and throughput metrics.
- Dynamic Data Scenarios: Features relying on user data or complex workflows may reveal issues that mocks miss.

There should be a mix of tests that verify real-life services and some that use mocks, when applicable, to achieve comprehensive coverage.

### Utilizing Fixtures with testSpecificMock

For more complex mock events or criteria, you can use the `mockSpecificTest` object to define custom mock events.

When using fixtures for E2E tests, you can leverage the `testSpecificMock` object to inject specific mocks into your test cases. This allows you to dynamically modify mock responses based on the scenario under test. For example:

```javascript
test.use({
  testSpecificMock: {
    GET: [
      {
        urlEndpoint:
          'https://gas.api.cx.metamask.io/networks/1/suggestedGasFees',
        response: { status: 200, message: 'Custom Success Response' },
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

This approach is particularly useful for targeted scenarios where pre-defined mock events in `mockEvents.js` might not be sufficient or applicable.

For example, see this [GitHub Reference](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-mobile/blob/d1946d2037399356b7b582b07e09b0528a68e0ac/e2e/specs/confirmations/advanced-gas-fees.mock.spec.js#L30).

### When mockEvents May Not Be Suitable

In certain cases, using `mockEvents` might not be ideal—for instance, when:

- The mock responses need to be dynamically created based on the test input.
- The scenario being tested is unique and requires a one-off response that doesn’t fit the general structure of `mockEvents`.
- Reusing existing mocks may lead to inconsistencies in the expected results.

In such cases, `testSpecificMock` is a more suitable option, allowing you to define bespoke mocks for individual tests.

### Current Workaround for Network Request Interception

Due to limitations in intercepting network requests directly, we currently route traffic through a proxy server. This lets us intercept and mock requests as needed.

## Future Improvements

We’re looking into further enhancements for our mocking setup to simplify processes and improve test coverage.
