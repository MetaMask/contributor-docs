## What is the goal of this repo?

This repository provides an arena for teams across the MetaMask engineering department to share, discuss, and record principles, practices, and patterns for building, maintaining, and releasing products and libraries within the MetaMask ecosystem in a unified fashion. Keeping this knowledge has three intended benefits:

- All contributors should be able to make changes to any part of MetaMask more easily.
- MetaMask teams should be able to ship code faster.
- The level of code quality within the MetaMask ecoystem should increase.

## What sort of documentation goes in this repo?

Anything is eligible for inclusion in this repository if:

- it could benefit a significant subset of MetaMask
- it is safe to share publicly

## How do I contribute?

Although parts of this repository were written by certain teams, the goal is for it to be useful to everyone in some way. If you see something missing from this documentation or have a different opinion on anything that may already exist, please feel free to open a pull request.
